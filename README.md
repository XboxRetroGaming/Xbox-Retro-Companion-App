## About Commander (Scripts Engine):
Commander built to help anyone to create unlimited scripts for different purposes using GUI elements

The script structure is very simple.

You can mix between commander codes and batch script (Telnet required) to get more advanced usage

I tried to add commands as much as I can to make it more usable.

Commander can be used like Automate.

Checkout the documentation with the installation file for more details and demos.
